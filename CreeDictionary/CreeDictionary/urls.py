# 2019/May/21 Matt Yan:

# The reason to have different rules in development/production:

# static file urls / web-page urls / API urls in this project all begin with "cree-dictionary"
# so that in production on server sapir, the cree-dictionary service can be proxy-ed by looking for
# initial "cree-dictionary" in the url.

# example url:
# http://sapir.artsrn.ualberta.ca/cree-dictionary/search/hello

# in development, though, the initial "cree-dictionary" is not needed, example:
# http://localhost:8000/search/hello
# Note: re_path here, for example "re_path("^(cree-dictionary/)?some/url")", isn't a good solution. It messes up with
# url reversion


# TODO: Convert this to an idiomatic Django style when we drop support for
# Sapir and mod-wsgi.
